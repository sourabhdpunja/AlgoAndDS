IN operator accepts more than 1 value

Select employee_id, dept from employees where dept_id IN (100, 200)

Difference between IN and EXIST when using in sub queries?
IN:: The inner query is executed first and the list of values obtained is used by the outer query.
Select emp_id, dept_id from employees where dept_id IN (select dept_id from dept);

The EXISTS operator is a logical operator that allows you to check whether a subquery returns any row. The EXISTS operator returns TRUE if the subquery returns one or more row.
Every row from the outer query is selected, then the inner query is executed and the outer query output uses the result for checking.

This process of inner query execution repeats as many number of times as there are outer query rows.

SELECT *
FROM customers
WHERE EXISTS 
  (SELECT *
   FROM orders
   WHERE customers.customer_id = orders.customer_id);
