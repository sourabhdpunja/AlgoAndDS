DISTINCT :: Returns distinct values
Select DISTINCT City from persons
LIKE :: Used to match a string to a pattern
Select * from persons where city like 'Io%'
AS:: To differentiate between fields with same name.
select s.name AS s1_name, d.name AS s2_name from Student s, dept d

GROUP BY:: group by clause works with aggregate functions. 
select column_name, agg_func(column_name) from table_name where column_name operator value GROUP BY column_name
select customer, SUM(OrderPrice) FROM orders GROUP BY customer

Group by is
– Evaluated after where clause
– Before select clause
Cant have aggregation functions in where clause because records have not yet been grouped

Difference between having and where clause?
where is used to filter out the data before the aggregation takes place.
having is used to filter out the data after the aggregation takes place.

select dept_id, sum(salary) as salary from employees where dept_id IN (10,20,30) group by dept_id having sum(salary) > 1000;

SELECT Customer,SUM(OrderPrice) FROM Orders
GROUP BY Customer
HAVING SUM(OrderPrice) < 2000

ORDER BY keyword sorts results by a column
• By default records are sorted ASCending
• Use DESC keyword to sort records in descending
order
• Syntax
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
ORDER BY column_name(s) ASC|DESC

SELECT * FROM Persons
ORDER BY LastName
