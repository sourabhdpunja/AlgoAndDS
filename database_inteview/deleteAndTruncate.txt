Difference between delete and truncate? which is faster?

Delete command is used to selectively remove rows from a table using a where clause. If no where condition is 
specified all rows are removed.

After performing a DELETE opertation you need to commit or rollback the transaction to make the changes permenant or undo it.

DELETE triggers on the table are fired if there are any triggers.

TRUNCATE removes all the rows from a table. You cannot roll back the data.
It does not affect any of the tables indexes, triggers or dependencies.
Since no UNDO log is maintained and has no dependencies TRUNCATE is faster.

where condition cannot be used with truncate.

Yes
