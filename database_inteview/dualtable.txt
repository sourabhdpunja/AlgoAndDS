What is a dual table? Why do we need it?
The DUAL table is a special one-row, one-column table present by default in Oracle and other database installations. In Oracle, the table has a single VARCHAR2(1) column called DUMMY that has a value of 'X'. 
It is suitable for use in selecting a pseudo column such as SYSDATE or USER.
It can be used to perform arithmatic calculations like 12 * 10
It can be used for sequence generation.

can we insert more rows into dual table?
Yes

select USER from dual;
select SYSDATE from dual;
select 12*10 from dual;

insert into dual values ('Y') ==> should be an adminsitrator

Can we drop all the columns from a table?

What is the difference between count(1), count(*)?
Nothing they are the same. They do the same thing.

SELECT 
    COUNT(*)
FROM
    employees;

SELECT
    department_id,
    COUNT(*)
FROM
    employees
GROUP BY
    department_id;
